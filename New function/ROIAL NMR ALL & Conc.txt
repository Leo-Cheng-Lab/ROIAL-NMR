This code operates independently of the graphical user interface (GUI) and is designed to run as a standalone program.

This code outputs all metabolites, regardless of their match ratio. It does not apply any filtering threshold based on the match ratio value.

The third output option specifically generates a comprehensive list of all detected metabolites, including:

Their corresponding ppm values

Their match ratios

And a ranking based on their reported concentration levels in HMDB (Human Metabolome Database) samples

In this third output mode, metabolites are sorted according to their HMDB concentration levels (from high to low), allowing users to prioritize metabolites that are typically present at higher biological concentrations.
